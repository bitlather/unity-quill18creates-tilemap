Unity version 4.5.1f3

Tutorial 7 includes 8 as well, and may be the last really useful directory. Quill18creates had some difficulty between tutorials 9 and 10, so it sounds like tutorial 9 was on the right track but it completely changes in 10. Tutorial 9 won't compile because ChopUpTiles() and BuildTexture() functions were deleted from TGMap9.cs, which are required for it to work.
